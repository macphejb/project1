    Crow is the founder of the Garden and the party’s main adversary. Having escaped several bouts against our heroes, 
    it seems Crow is always one step ahead. A smooth talker, he was once able to convince the party he was an ally, merely 
    distracting them as a nearby city was decimated. Crow was born blind but learned to interpret the world through magic.
    His true goals are unknown.
