    Olek was born to a wandering tribe of careful Tortle. For as long as he can remember, he never fit in. He was constantly criticized for 
    his clumsiness. Eventually, having had enough, he ran away from home on a journey to find real civilization. He had to learn to provide 
    for himself in the wilderness and became an expert at hunting and preparing his meals. Olek becomes a monster on the battlefield, literally. 
    Through sheer rage, he grows his natural claws, maw, and tail into deadly weapons.
