    Not much is known of Dudo’s origins. He keeps the truths of his past hidden, even to his closest friends. Wherever he came from, 
    it was likely his paranoia that drove him out. What he can’t hide are his skills. Dudo moves like a shadow, leaving his enemies 
    no time to react until he has a knife at their throat. His moral code (or lack thereof) often clashes against Miya’s want for order.
