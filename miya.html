  <p class = "bio">
    Miya studied law in Farrowdale before her beloved was killed in front of her by a demented witch. Miya channeled 
    her grief and anger into a drive to protect the weak, devoting herself to Tyr: the god of justice. Miyaâ€™s no-nonsense 
    demeanor sometimes grates against the whims of her companions, but her resourcefulness keeps her in a position of leadership. 
    She is a massive boon on the battlefield, simultaneously commanding the fight and providing blessings and aid to her allies.

    so we should try our hardest to help one another." -Miya Areno
