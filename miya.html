    Miya studied law in Farrowdale before her beloved was killed in front of her by a demented witch. Miya channeled 
    her grief and anger into a drive to protect the weak, devoting herself to Tyr: the god of justice. Miyaâ€™s no-nonsense 
    demeanor sometimes grates against the whims of her companions, but her resourcefulness keeps her in a position of leadership. 
    She is a massive boon on the battlefield, simultaneously commanding the fight and providing blessings and aid to her allies.

    "The gods overlook our mortal struggles and the law does not punish those who evade it. No one is going to save us but ourselves, 
    so we should try our hardest to help one another." -Miya Areno
